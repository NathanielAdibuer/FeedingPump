# Feeding Pump Project
  Premature death through respiratory distress syndrome and malnutrition is one of the leading causes of increased mortality in preterm babies. Preterm babies lack mature neurophysiological function that allows them self-coordinate their feeding process. In low to middle-income countries (LMICs), there is a high dependency on health care professionals to manually feed premature babies due to the lack of affordable automatic feeding systems. The project goal was to design an automated feeding system that will deliver breast milk to premature babies in LMICs within the local technology and design constraints, hence helping reduce the pressure on health care professionals and allowing clinicians to accurately deliver the required volume of nutrition at the appropriate flow rate to the preterm babies. The final design allows the clinician to enter two variables which are the flowrate and volume of breast milk and the information is then sent to a microprocessor to process the input data and accurately administer the nutrition to the preterm baby. The design comprises of a microprocessor, a liquid crystal display (LCD) and pushbuttons, voltage and current sensors, a temperature sensor, peristaltic pump and a buzzer and LEDs. The automated feeding system which was designed was able to administer nutrition at flowrates within 5ml -15ml with a maximum error margin of +/- 3ml, and also able to administer 20ml â€“ 60ml of nutrition.
